# audit_helper 0.5.0
This version brings full compatibility with dbt-core 1.0. It requires any version (minor and patch) of v1, which means far less need for compatibility releases in the future.

# audit_helper 0.4.1
ðŸš¨ This is a compatibility release in preparation for `dbt-core` v1.0.0 (ðŸŽ‰). Projects using this version with dbt-core v1.0.x can expect to see a deprecation warning. This will be resolved in the next minor release.
